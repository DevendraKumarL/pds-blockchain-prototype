  -> use some kind of messages/error codes for handling exceptions
    ==> use either event or return with customer error codes
  -> A page to generate hash of a secret key => "NodeJs"
  -> // from: "./app/registration/customer.html", to: "registration/customer.html" ??
  -> How to check if
        *SellToCustomer_HashLog
        *SupplyCentralToStateGovernment_HashLog
      confirmed or not ??
    -> Should it be added to the final transfer log analytics/graph/stats ??
